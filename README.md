# Geo Trainer

A modern, interactive web application for learning world capital cities. Test and improve your geography knowledge through an adaptive quiz system.

Note: This project was developed entirely using vscode-insiders Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Preview) Agent. I decided to test the limits of the agent and for the most part it went very smooth. Had very little problems where I've had to deal with. Personally touched zero code. Only prompts.

## Features

- **Adaptive Learning System**: 
  - Start with 5 initial countries
  - Earn points for correct answers and lose points for incorrect ones
  - New countries are unlocked when you master the current set (8 points threshold)
  - 3 new countries are added each time you master a set
- **Progress Tracking**:
  - Track your knowledge points for each country
  - Visual progress indicators
  - Persistent storage of your progress
- **Interactive UI**:
